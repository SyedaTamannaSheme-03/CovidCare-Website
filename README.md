# CovidCare-Website

Problem definition-

The world is seeing increasing cases of Covid-19 virus. Hospital beds get filled as soon as a 
Covid-19 wave hits. This is making people more and more anxious as days pass. To tackle all 
these distress, this software system will be aimed at building a community for the people where 
they can come together and collect all the information regarding the covid-19 virus. Not only 
will they be able to help each other by sharing their experience but they will also be guided by 
experienced doctors. As a result people will not rush and crowd the hospitals as soon as they get 
mild symptoms of the Covid-19 virus. They can ensure the seriousness of their symptom sitting 
at home and they can know when exactly they need to contact hospitals. In the software’s initial 
stage, the system will be designed to help the people in Bangladesh, that is the doctors and users 
involved will be region specific and all the information in the database will be for Bangladesh 
only.
